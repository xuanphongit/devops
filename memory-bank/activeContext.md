# Active Context: E-Commerce Platform

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus: Week 1 - Architecture Design & Project Setup

### What We're Working On
Setting up the foundational architecture and project structure for the e-commerce platform. This includes designing the system architecture, selecting appropriate technologies, and preparing the development environment.

### Recent Decisions Made
1. **Technology Stack Confirmed**:
   - Backend: .NET 8 with ASP.NET Core
   - Frontend: Vue.js 3 with Vuetify
   - Database: PostgreSQL + Redis
   - Message Queue: RabbitMQ
   - Infrastructure: GKE with Terraform

2. **Architecture Pattern Selected**:
   - Microservices architecture with event-driven communication
   - API Gateway pattern for external access
   - Database per service pattern
   - GitOps deployment with Argo CD

3. **Project Structure Defined**:
   - Clear separation between services, infrastructure, and frontend
   - Memory bank created for project continuity
   - Task-driven development approach

### Completed This Session âœ…
1. **System Architecture Diagram**
   - âœ… Complete visual representation of all components
   - âœ… Service relationships and data flow documented
   - âœ… Infrastructure layout clearly defined

2. **Project Repository Structure**
   - âœ… Enhanced folder structure with all Day 1 requirements
   - âœ… GitOps overlays for dev/staging/prod environments
   - âœ… Monitoring stack directories (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
   - âœ… Terraform modules for GKE, CloudSQL, VPC, DNS
   - âœ… .gitkeep files in all directories for git tracking

3. **Service Specifications (Day 1 Focus)**
   - âœ… 6 core microservices defined: Auth, Product, Cart, Order, Notification, Gateway
   - âœ… API Gateway with YARP for request routing
   - âœ… Vue.js frontend renamed to vuejs-ui
   - âœ… Detailed service contracts and responsibilities

4. **Documentation**
   - âœ… Updated README.md with enhanced project structure
   - âœ… Comprehensive design.md with microservice specifications
   - âœ… DevOps and GitOps approach documented
   - âœ… Infrastructure overview and security architecture

### Immediate Next Steps (Remaining)
1. **Database Schema Design**
   - Detailed table structures for each service database
   - Foreign key relationships and constraints
   - Migration scripts preparation

2. **Event Schema Finalization**
   - RabbitMQ exchange and queue configurations
   - Event payload specifications
   - Message routing patterns

3. **Monitoring Configuration**
   - Prometheus scraping configurations
   - Grafana dashboard templates
   - Alerting rules setup

### Active Considerations
- **Complexity vs. Simplicity**: Balancing comprehensive architecture with implementation simplicity
- **Local Development**: Ensuring easy setup for new developers
- **Cloud Costs**: Optimizing for cost-effectiveness while maintaining scalability
- **Security First**: Implementing security patterns from the beginning

### Questions to Address
1. Should we implement all microservices initially or start with a modular monolith?
2. What's the authentication flow between frontend and microservices?
3. How do we handle distributed transactions (e.g., order placement)?
4. What's our approach to API versioning and backward compatibility?

### Dependencies & Blockers
- **None currently** - We're in the initial design phase
- Need to validate technology choices with any specific constraints
- Should consider team expertise and learning curve

### Context for Next Session
After completing Week 1 tasks, we'll move into:
- **Week 2**: Core microservices development starting with Auth Service
- **Infrastructure Setup**: Terraform configurations for GKE
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow setup

### Key Resources
- Task.md: Contains week 1 specific requirements
- Project Brief: Overall project vision and requirements
- System Patterns: Architectural decisions and patterns
- Tech Context: Technology stack and development setup

This week establishes the foundation that all future development will build upon.
